I have been trading stocks unsuccessfully for 16 years. In 2017, I stumbled upon cryptocurrencies, opening a whole new world of carryover loss opportunities. While masterfully avoiding profits, I discovered my inner tech enthusiast, and took the phrase “in it for the tech” to heart. I’ve learned how to write, deploy, and verify solidity contracts on Ethereum, a skill that may seem impressive but doesn’t get dates. I’ve also ventured into Solana interacting with program accounts through apis and typescript, immensely expanding my extreme nerdiness. Ever heard of Ordinals? Ok, probably not, but I created some early resulting in one of many airdrops that I redistributed across blockchains. While trading nfts and tokens may not be my thing, the knowledge gained from curiosity is something I continue to pursue in my quest for a career in crypto.
